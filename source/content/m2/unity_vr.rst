Unity VR Development

Indroduction to VR Development
--------------------------------

Virtual Reality(VR) is a rapidly expanding technology that is becoming more and more integrated into everyday life. As such, application development for this medium is at an all-time high. Learning how to create applications for VR is more important now than ever, and Unity is the best tool for beginning this journey. Follow this tutorial closely, as the techniques learned here will not only be critical to being successful in future tutorials, but also in building skills for the incoming VR boom.

Why Unity?

As stated in the introduction, Unity will be the tool of choice for development in VR. Unity is *the* best pick for anyone looking to develop for VR, for a multitude of reasons. First, Unity has a large variety of actively updated packages to facilitate building out a VR package, something that other engines lack. Second, Unity has multiple ways to build and test a VR application, by controlling the build of the project. Unity VR projects can be built as standalone Android applications, meaning that they do not require a computer to be connected to the headset to run the app. They can also be built for Windows, allowing them to run alongside a computer for easier testing and modification. Lastly, Unity was chosen due to its thriving development community and ease of access, both of which offer newcomers a level of support that you would be unlikely to come accross elsewhere. These are the main reasons Unity was chosen, and why most VR developers opt to use Unity as well.

Creating a VR Project
----------------------

Creating a new Unity project for VR is very similar to the way you created the mobile project in the last section. Do the following to get your VR project created:

1. Launch Unity Hub and login to your Unity account. If you do not have either of these completed, see :ref:`new_to_install`.

2. On the sidebar on the left side of the application, select the *Projects* tab.

3. On the top right of the application, press the button titled *New project*.

4. Under the templates section, select the *VR Core* option. You may have to download the template if you have not used it already. The button to download it can be seen on the right side of the application after clicking on the template.

5. Choose a name for your project. It can be anything you like, but we recommend naming it with one word in order to make file access easier. For now, let's call it *MyFirstVRProject*.

6. Choose the where you'd like to store your project. Be sure to pick a location that is easy to find.

7. Click the *Create project* button in the bottom right corner of the application. This will create the project and launch the editor.

Pre-Project Setup
-------------------

Unlike the simple mobile game you saw in :ref:`install_to_new`, a VR project will require a larger setup process before you begin work. These steps are not optional, and should be followed closely.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Project and Build Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you recall the :ref:`to_mobile_setup` subsection of module one, you will remember the mention of *Project Settings* and *Build Settings*. While the simple mobile application that was made in that module did not require any modification of these settings, that is not the case for this more advanced tutorial. The following changes to these settings are necessary for your project to run correctly, so please make sure to do all of them:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Essential Packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Additionally, there are some packages you will need for this project, and since you likely haven't used the Unity package manager yet, the following steps will teach you how to install the packages you need for this project, and will also serve as a template for installing any Unity package from the package manager:

1. Launch Unity Hub and login to your Unity account.

#. On the sidebar to the left of the application, select the *Projects* tab.

#. Open the project you created in :ref:`to_create_vr`.
