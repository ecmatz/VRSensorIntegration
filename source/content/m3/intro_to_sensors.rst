Introduction to Physiological Sensors
======================================

**How can we use technology to help diagnose disorders, improve athletic performance, and guide rehabilitation?** We will start to answer this question in this section of the tutorial by giving an overview of the sensors used to measure physiological information about the human body. By studying how strong muscles are, how much air the lungs can circulate, how fast the heart can pump blood throughout the body, and more, we can gain a better understanding of how the human body behaves and design tools that help people achieve their goals.

The information on each sensor will be organized as follows: first, we'll give a brief overview of what it's used for, then some instruction on how it is worn and what it measures (including reliability of the data), and perhaps most importantly, some discussion on what you could study or build using it.

Surface Electromyography: Delsys Trigno
---------------------------------------

Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a technique used to measure electromyographic signals that correspond to muscle activity. Muscles throughout the human body are activated in response to neural stimulation from the brain, and as they contract, they release an electrical impulse that circulates throughout bones and tissue. These impulses are captured by the sEMG sensor, and after applying some signal processing techniques that we'll see later in this tutorial, they can be incredibly useful in studying the patterns of our muscles.

For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll be using the Delsys sEMG sensors, widely regarded for their clinical-grade quality in research and industrial settings. Specifically, three of their most common products are the Trigno Avanti, Trigno Mini, and Trigno Quattro sensors.

* The `Trigno Avanti <https://delsys.com/trigno-avanti/>`_ is their "standard" sEMG sensor.
* The `Trigno Mini <https://delsys.com/trigno-mini/>`_ is a smaller form factor sensor, allowing you to get data from muscles that may be harder to reach with the Avanti.
* The `Trigno Quattro <https://delsys.com/trigno-quattro/>`_ is similar to the Trigno Mini, but there are four sensing heads, allowing you to get precise data from multiple locations.

Each of these devices also contains an **IMU (inertial measurement unit)** sensor, which reports data on acceleration and orientation. This can be used in conjunction with the sEMG signal to understand the motion of the muscle. 

The sensors are placed on the surface of the skin and stick via a simple adhesive. Be careful as to where you place them, since they should be placed as close to the muscle as possible to achieve high-quality results. The surface of the skin should also be cleaned with an alcohol wipe before placing the sensor to remove any oils or contaminants which could interfere with the electrical signal. For more information on placing the sensors, consult the user guides that come with the products.

Traditionally, intramuscular electromyography (iEMG) is another technique used to measure muscle activity by sticking a needle inside the skin next to a particular muscle. While this is still used in some clinical applications, especially when muscles are deep into the skin or have a small cross-sectional area, it is becoming an increasingly less popular approach as it is more invasive for data collection.

Finally, an important concept in most sEMG applications is **maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)**. In order to measure muscle strength, especially in patients with neuromuscular disorders, we have the patient flex a certain muscle as much as they can and use the resulting sEMG value as a baseline. Then, all future readings are compared as a percentage of MVC.

Applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned previously, sEMG can be used to study a wide variety of behaviors. We'll provide some examples here. Many of these applications involve developing machine learning algorithms for automated classification based on sEMG signals, though this is not necessary.

* It can help diagnose certain muscular disorders, including muscular dystrophy and chronic pain [#]_ [#]_.
* It can help identify nerve dysfunction and muscle fatigue [#]_ [#]_ [#]_ [#]_.
* It can be used as a control signal for prosthetic and other robotic devices [#]_ [#]_ [#]_.
* It can be used to help understand human motions via the collection of large-scale sEMG datasets to train machine learning algorithms [#]_ [#]_.
