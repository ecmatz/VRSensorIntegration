Data Collection with Physiological Sensors
============================================
Now that you have explored both Unity and the various types of physiological sensors, it's time to begin integrating them together. You will do this using the **Delsys Trigno Link**, a device that allows multiple physiological sensors to be connected to a single computer via bluetooth. THis tutorial will include an in-depth tutorial on how to connect and setup the Trigno Link, and how to collect data from the sensors attached to it. You will start simple, and devlope a simple, command-line based Unity application that prints out the data recieved rom the sensors. The main goal of this module is to ensure that you can effectively use and read from the Trigno Link, and access that data in Unity. Once you have these basics down, the next module wll move on to more complex integration techniques using VR.
