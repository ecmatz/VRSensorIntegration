**Installing Unity Hub**

Unity Hub is a container application used to store and access our Unity Projects.
You can download and install it `here <https://unity.com/download>`_.

From here, do the following:

#. Create a Unity account.
#. Install the latest LTS Unity Editor
    * A list of all the currently supported releases can be found `here <https://unity.com/releases/editor/qa/lts-releases?major_version=&minor_version=&version=&page=1>`_.
    * **[Important]** Make sure to install the "Android Build Support" module and Visual Studio Code (if you do not already have it) alongside the editor install.
#. The installation is now complete. You will see how to create a new project in :ref:`install_to_new`.
