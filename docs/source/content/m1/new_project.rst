New Project
===============

For our first project, we'll be designing a simple mobile mobile application for Android. Use the following steps to get started:

#. Launch Unity Hub and login to your Unity account. If you do not have either of these completed, see :ref:`new_to_install`.

#. On the sidebar on the left side of the application, select the "Projects" tab.

#. On the top right of the application, press the button titled "New project".

#. Under the templates section, select the "2D Mobile" option. You may have to download the template if you have not used it already. The button to download it can be seen on the right side of the application after clicking on the template.

#. Choose a name for your project. It can be anything you like, but we recommend naming it with one word in order to make file access easier. An example of a good project title would be *MyFirstProject*.
#. Choose the location where to store your project. Be sure to pick a location that is easy to find.
#. Click the "Create project" button in the bottom right corner of the application. This will create the project and launch the editor.
