.. warning::
  There is a known bug preventing the usage of the Delsys API with specific versions of Unity. While it is unknown exactly which versions are affected, 2022.3.7f1 has been tested and is working, so that is what will be used here and what is recommended for you to use as well. You can attempt other versions as well, but be aware that they may not work. Older version of Unity, such as 2021.3.0f1 are known to work as well (being used for Delsys's own Example Application), but they may lack access to modern VR packages. Depending on your use-case, this may or may not be an issue. 

While working through these tutorials, you may encounter some issues using Unity that you need individualized assistance to solve. Luckily, Unity has a large community that provides a multitude of resources to help diagnose specific issues. While a simple search on the internet may be able to help you find your issue, oftentimes you will find more success with the following resources:

* `Unity Forum <https://forum.unity.com/>`_

* `Unity Issue Tracker <https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/>`_

* `Unity Support <https://support.unity.com/hc/en-us>`_

* `Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/>`_

Additionally, countless videos on YouTube and social media posts may help you find others who have experienced similar problems and discovered a solution. If none of the above resources are able to solve your issue, these might help. Again, the pool of Unity knowledge runs because of its prevalence in the development space, so hopefully the solution to your problem is out there somewhere. Good luck in troubleshooting, and hang in there!
